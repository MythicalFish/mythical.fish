# üê† &nbsp;Mythical Fish  

My [portfolio](https://mythical.fish), built using Gatsby, PostCSS, Tailwind, and PurgeCSS.

## What I did

- Started with [gatsby-starter-tailwind](https://github.com/taylorbryant/gatsby-starter-tailwind/tree/0cde62d79f463919c0ecd03e1e3fa90b160de580)
- Added PostCSS, CSSNext, etc.
- Configured PostCSS to load Tailwind
- Modified npm scripts to run PostCSS alongside Gatsby
- Fixed PurgeCSS config (searching \*.html cause false positives)
- Organized stylesheets more nicely
