For this project, a beautiful website was designed for me to implement in any way I saw fit.

Instead of Wordpress (which I've often used in the past for projects of this type), I opted to use Rails. One might think that Rails would be overkill for a project like this, but it turned out to fit the client's needs perfectly. I made use of rails_admin, Code Mirror, and a clever implementation to quickly provide an admin interface which allows the site to be totally customized, and all of the content managed in a simple way.

The client was very happy with the implementation: editable HTML partials which can be included in pages or other partials using simple identifier tags, and an image manager which works much the same way, but provides URLs to the CDN hosted images.
