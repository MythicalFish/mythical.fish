Weavenote allows fashion designers to login to their organization, collaboratively create projects, upload images, annotate those images, add measurements, materials, comments, instructions, and ultimately produce "tech sheets" which are PDFs to be given to clothing manufacturers. 

I built this complex browser-based app over several months, using React and Rails; it's currently awaiting a little more funding to get it off the ground.
