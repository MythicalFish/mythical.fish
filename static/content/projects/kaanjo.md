I built Kaanjo for a client in 2016, it consists of 2 parts: the JS plugin, and the Dashboard. 

The plugin is for eCommerce websites and blogs, and it renders Facebook-style reaction icons (Like, Love, etc.).

The dashboard allows website owners to sign in, and provides an overview their collected data, see which pages (or products) are being reacted to, and of course which reactions their users are having. They can create multiple campaigns, each having different parameters, and custom end-user messages and icons (uploaded or chosen from a library of icons).
