I normally wouldn't include a Wordpress project on my portfolio, because it's not the kind of work I do anymore. However I'm including this project from 2017 because I'm actually pretty proud of myself for successfully completing it... It was very, very difficult project, and not because of the work itself.

With only 2 weeks before the company would appear on television in front of literally millions of people, I was given the challenge of building (and largely designing) their front-facing website.

Initially I was excited to take on the challenge, but within an hour of accepting the job, I came to realize why the previous 2 developers failed to complete the project.

In the shared folder was a disorganized mess of randomly named (often duplicated) documents, mockups, and Google Slides rammed full of almost unintelligible instructions, text content, and layout guidelines - all mixed together for me to decipher and implement. Hundreds of them. Some of which were to be ignored, but some of which contained information which was totally crucial for the project. Combined with hot-tempered, erratic, next-level micromanagement... I feel like I deserve medal for keeping the client happy and completing it in time!

I wouldn't normally mention such a thing publicly, but this was truly something else. :)
