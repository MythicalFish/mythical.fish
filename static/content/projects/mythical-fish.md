For building this portfolio I decided to use Gatsby and Netlify CMS, which grants multiple benefits.

Gatsby allowed me to write React code in order to build and generate a static website which is both super-fast, and search-engine friendly. The content of this site is saved in a markdown format which is accesible to the app via GraphQL. Whenever an update is pushed (whether from the command line or via the CMS), the site rebuilds itself.

Pretty neat!
