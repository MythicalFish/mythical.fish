For building this portfolio I decided to use Gatsby and Netlify CMS, which grants multiple benefits.

Gatsby allowed me to write React code in order to build and generate a static website which is both super-fast, and search-engine friendly. The content of this site is saved in a markdown format which is accesible to the app via GraphQL. Whenever an update is pushed (whether from the command line or via the CMS), the site rebuilds itself.

It also generates my CV as a PDF file.

Pretty neat!
