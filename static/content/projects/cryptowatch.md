I had a lot of fun working on this project alongside a fantastic team of talented engineers. In the first year, I was really involved in general improvements codebase, assisted in implementing a coding style guide, and arranged regular meetings for frontend engineers. I tackled huge amounts of tech debt, revamped the CSS, advocated for the adoption of Tailwind, worked on performance optimization, and even developed backend functionality in Golang. Afterwards our attention shifted towards feature delivery. Some of the more prominent features I personally developed include the credits/payment & subscriptions system, and the utility belt. 

Unfortunately, my final year at the company was less fulfilling. Our productive and driven all-star team of around 40 engineers, underwent massive disruption to to the parent company's ambitious push for growth.
