The Public House of Art was the first big project I took on as a freelancer; I worked with them from the very beginning, and I built their entire online platform, as well as provided input on its design. 

I built this website using Ruby on Rails, and Spree - the biggest, most supported ecommerce framework for Rails. Spree is rock-solid, and is totally customizable and extendable, which allowed me to create or modify features & functionality, in order to meet the client's specifications. These features included:
 
- The ability to add & administer artists, and associate them with their product (artworks).
- Their unique price-tiering system and mount options.
- A customized checkout flow, and a totally custom integration with a small Dutch payment gateway provider.
