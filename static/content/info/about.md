I'm a (seriously) full-stack software engineer; I architect & build apps for the web and for mobile.

I could start by saying that I’m a senior engineer, but sometimes senior just means expensive, so what I’ll tell you is that I have more than 11 years of real-world, professional experience in planning, building, and deploying web apps of all kinds; and more than 7 years of freelancing experience - working directly with companies (often startups), in order to bring their visions to life.

I'm absolutely itching to jump into a new project. Ideally a startup. 

I want to be deeply involved in its technical development, and built strong, happy, and lasting rapport with my new colleagues. I want to find something that I can really give all of myself to, and find fulfillment there.
