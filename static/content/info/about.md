I'm super excited to jump into a new project. Ideally a startup. 

I want to be deeply involved in its technical development, and built strong, happy, and lasting rapport with my new colleagues. I want to find something that I can really give all of myself to, and find fulfillment through hard work and high output.

I'm financially quite happy already, so salary is not the most important factor for me.

I'm a well-spoken Englishman, and I also speak French and Spanish fluently. I've been working professionally as a software engineer 11+ years, and working remotely for more than 7 years. If we work together, I'll bring not only my experience & expertise, but also enthusiasm, creative-thinking, and a genuine desire to see the project succeed. 

- I usually aim for 6 distraction-free hours of work per day
- I'm not a fan of live coding challenges, but a test project is fine
- I'd favor a hybrid position over fully-remote

<u>AI is here!</u> Absolutely wild. I'm fully embracing what's to come, and aiming to leverage it beyond just the increase in productivity (which I'm already seeing).
