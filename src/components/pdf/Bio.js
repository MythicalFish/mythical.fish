      <p>
        Hi there. I'm a (seriously) full-stack software engineer; I architect & build apps for the web and for mobile.
      </p>
      <p>
        I could start by saying that I’m a senior engineer, but sometimes senior just means expensive, so what I’ll tell you is that I have more than 8 years of real-world, professional experience in planning, building, and deploying web apps of all kinds; and more than 3 years of freelancing experience - working directly with companies (often startups), in order to bring their visions to life.
      </p>
      <p>Right now I’m looking for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Long-term partnerships with awesome people.</li>
        <li>
          Involvement in a cool project, preferably doing frontend or full-stack work.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remote work - a change of environment once in a while is invaluable to me.
        </li>
      </ul>

    </div>
  )
}

export default Bio
